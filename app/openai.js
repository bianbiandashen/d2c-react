  "redux-thunk": "latest", // Middleware for Redux asynchronous actions
  "react-icons": "latest", // A set of free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG icons
- Remember to add them as imports at the top of App.js file. 
- Be helpful by going beyond UI and layout and implement all inferrable functions. 
- Make multiple components within file and reference them in App() if you need to.

IMPORTS AT THE TOP ARE CRUCIAL.
You may leverage the following imports, as they are already in your package.json file:
"react": "latest", // React is a dependency of React Native
"react-native": "latest", // The React Native framework
"redux": "latest", // For state management
"axios": "latest", // For making HTTP requests
"react-native-vector-icons": "latest", // For icons, do not use @expo/vector-icons.

When using the MaterialCommunityIcons and others import like this: react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons. 
In fact, you can just modify the contents of this perfect example below.

import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Button, Image, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";
import MaterialCommunityIcons from "react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <View style={styles.header}>
          <Image
            accessibilityLabel="React logo"
            source={{ uri: logoUri }}
            resizeMode="contain"
            style={styles.logo}
          />
          <Text style={styles.title}>React Native for Web</Text>
        </View>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          To get started, edit{" "}
          <Link href="https://codesandbox.io/s/q4qymyp2l6/" style={styles.code}>
            src/App.js
          </Link>
          .
        </Text>
        <Button onPress={() => {}} title="Example button" />
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  app: {
    marginHorizontal: "auto",
    maxWidth: 500,
  },
  logo: {
    height: 80,
  },
  header: {
    padding: 20,
  },
  title: {

    fontSize: "1.5rem",

Also remember imports like SafeAreaView, Text, View, StyleSheet, etc.
